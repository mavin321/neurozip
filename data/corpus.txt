# Sample Text Corpus for NeuroZip Training

NeuroZip is an AI-based text compression engine that uses a tiny LSTM neural network instead of traditional fixed algorithms. The core principle is predictive coding: the LSTM learns the probability distribution of the next byte given a sequence of preceding bytes. This allows the range coder to assign fewer bits to highly probable symbols.

The complexity of the C++ core is handled by CMake. The training happens in Python using PyTorch, which provides the necessary gradient descent optimization for the LSTM weights.

# Function Example (Python)

def calculate_entropy(data):
    """Calculates the empirical entropy of a byte sequence."""
    if not data:
        return 0
    
    from collections import Counter
    counts = Counter(data)
    total = len(data)
    entropy = 0.0

    for count in counts.values():
        probability = count / total
        # Shannon entropy formula: -p * log2(p)
        entropy -= probability * (probability)
        
    return entropy
