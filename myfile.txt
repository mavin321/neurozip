[Configuration]
compression_level = 9  # Max compression
output_filename = compressed_data.nzp
log_verbosity = 2      # 0=Silent, 1=Errors, 2=Info, 3=Debug

[Notes]
1. Remember to implement robust CRC32 checking on read and write operations.
2. The initial file header size should be fixed (38 bytes) to ensure predictable parsing.
3. Need to investigate better error handling beyond the current ErrorCode enum. Specifically, how to return OS-level IO errors.

[Dependencies]
- std::cstdint (Confirmed)
- std::string (Confirmed)
- std::vector (Confirmed)
